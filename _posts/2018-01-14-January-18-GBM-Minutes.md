[resolution attached]

Resolution to Create the Montgomery County Election Working Group and to Hold Endorsement Votes for County Council and Executive Candidates
18-01-R04
Adopted by unanimous consent.
Added to minutes 1/21/18

Resolution
Therefore, be it resolved that the general body of the Metro DC Democratic Socialists of America:
Authorizes creation of the Montgomery County Council and County Executive Elections Working Group, which will:
Elect a leadership team consisting of two chairs, one advocate (who is not a member of any candidate’s campaign staff) for each endorsed candidate, and one campaign finance compliance officer; and
Be limited in scope to organizing on behalf of chapter-endorsed candidates in the Montgomery County, Maryland council and executive races for the 2018 election cycle.
Will immediately hold separate endorsement votes of the following candidates, who, if they receive a two-thirds majority, will be included under the operational scope of the working group mentioned in item 1 of this resolution. The candidates for vote are listed below:
Marc Elrich for County Executive
Danielle Meitiv for County Council, at-large
Chris Wilhelm for County Council, at-large
Brandy Brooks for County Council, at-large
Background
The Democratic primary election for all nine Montgomery County, Maryland county council seats and the county executive will occur on June 26, 2018. This will be the first Montgomery County election in which newly enacted term-limit laws prevent incumbents from seeking reelection. As a result, three of four at-large county council seats will have no incumbent running (one incumbent is not term-limited and is seeking reelection). The county executive seat is also open. Due to the lack of incumbents, almost 30 candidates have entered the at-large council races. There were six candidates in 2014.
The absence of incumbents and the high number of candidates in these races means that the number of votes required to win will be far lower than in previous years. These conditions dictate that candidates who reach a high number of voters and who have strong campaign field operations will have a better chance of victory. In previous elections, members of Metro DC DSA have shown that we can deliver the level of campaign field support necessary to help endorsed candidates win in Montgomery County. Therefore, with a Metro DC DSA endorsement, our chapter’s support could be the difference between victory and defeat for candidates in the Montgomery County Council elections.
By chartering the working group as structured above, our goal is to ensure that this campaign is led by one comprehensive, coordinated, and inclusive body. We want to prevent a situation in which candidates and DSA members are competing with each other for volunteers or other chapter resources. Forming a working group with representation from all interested parties will allow DSA to ensure that volunteer time and resources are used to maximize the benefit of all endorsed candidates.

Adopted, General Body, 1/14/18
