<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Democratic Socialist Labor Commission Elections</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In 2017 the DSA national convention voted to form the Democratic Socialist Labor Commission (DSLC). This body is responsible for leading the organization’s work around labor and workers rights. At this most recent convention in 2019 our organization voted for a whole new set of ambitious priorities for labor. Now the DSLC is preparing to elect a new steering committee to carry this work out.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">If you are part of the labor working group, a current or retired union members, staff for a union, part of an active organizing campaign, or are otherwise involved with labor as a journalist or academic you are eligible to join the DSLC and vote in this election. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfJKKG5SdKOLSEhdPilJynx1CjRFjTp0gLamkALlIMkkobKaQ/viewform"><strong>You can join the DSLC by using this form to become eligible to vote.</strong></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Even if you are not intending to vote, you should still join the DSLC so that you can stay updated and involved in labor work in DSA happening at the national level. If you do intend to vote <strong>you have until January 6th to join</strong>. Even if you are currently on the DSLC list or the local labor list, you must still fill out this form in order to retain your seat and have a vote. The election itself will be held in February. MDC DSA publications will circulate more information about the DSLC election as it is released.</span></p>
