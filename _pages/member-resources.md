## Red Desk
The Red Desk is Metro DC DSA's internal support system. At the Red Desk, you can submit requests for pretty much anything in the chapter, including:

Social media posts

Funding for chapter-approved expenses

Agenda items for the General Body Meeting or an upcoming Steering Committee meeting

Use of chapter equipment for approved events

Graphics or text for promotional materials

With the Red Desk, you can track your request status and make sure that the appropriate committee handles it in a timely fashion.

You can get started with it <a href="https://reddesk.mdcdsa.org/">here</a>.
