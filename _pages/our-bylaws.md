The meeting shall be run according to the adopted parliamentary authority and other procedures approved by the members. A meeting of the members shall be defined as a General Body Meeting or a Local Convention. The General Body Membership shall convene in a meeting of the members at least once a month. In the absence of a Local Convention, the members present and assembled at a General Body Meeting represent the General Body Membership and are the highest decision-making authority in the organization. The General Body Membership shall allow for the democratic introduction of proposals through a resolution process. Resolutions can be introduced by any member at a General Body Meeting (see section, titled “Resolutions).


## Other Meetings

## Special Meetings

## The Steering Committee

By majority vote of the Committee or petition of 5 percent of the Membership, may call a Special Meeting on at least seven days’ notice when an urgent and important matter requires deliberation. No matters other than those listed in the meeting notice may be brought to or raised from the floor at a Special Meeting. Voting may be conducted at a Special Meeting on those matters listed in the meeting notice.

## Informational Meetings

The Steering Committee may call additional chapter-wide Informational Meetings for a variety of reasons but at which voting business will not be conducted and policies will not be set. For the purposes of these bylaws, chapter-wide Informational Meetings should not be considered General Body Meetings.

## Urgent Matters

Urgent matters that would regularly require a GBM vote may be voted on by the Steering Committee and, if adopted, be put to a ratification vote by a majority or two-thirds vote as the bylaws require, at the next voting meeting.

## Voting Rights

All members shall be enfranchised and have the right to vote on all proceedings brought before the general body. Voting,” in the context of the above sections, shall refer to synchronous or asynchronous voting, in-person or remotely, pursuant to these bylaws.

## Absentee Voting

## Process

MDC DSA shall offer absentee voting on any measure which is to be considered by a vote of a general body meeting of a members of MDCDSA (each such measure, a “Proposal”). For any Proposal, there shall be at least one in-person meeting of the members for oral discussion and debate of the issue. Prior to the day of the in-person meeting of the members, there shall also be an online discussion period of at least three days. Absentee voting shall open for three days immediately following the in-person meeting of the members, during which time online discussion shall be ongoing.

## Eligibility

In order to be eligible for absentee voting, members must have joined DSA more than 30 days prior to the in-person meeting of the members or have attended the relevant in-person meeting of the members. This restriction does not apply to voting in person.

## Absentee Ballots

A Credentials Committee, a Sub-Committee of the Administrative Committee, shall be responsible for developing an effective, accessible, and secure method for online discussion and absentee voting. The identity of the member requesting an absentee ballot shall be securely authenticated at the time the ballot is issued. Summaries of the online and in person discussions and access to the complete records of these discussions shall be made available on the same interface as the absentee ballot. The Administrative Committee shall be responsible for the creation, administration, and collection of absentee ballots as well as informing the Secretary of the names of absentee voters and the results.


## Proposals & Amendments

Proposals must be submitted and distributed no later than one day in advance of the period of online discussion. Amendments to Proposals must be submitted before absentee voting opens. Any amendment not accepted by the primary Proposal’s authors may either be withdrawn by those submitting it or added to the absentee ballot as alternative version of the primary Proposal.
## Exceptional and Emergency Circumstances

In exceptional and/or emergency circumstances in which deliberation on a Proposal cannot be delayed until the required conditions are met, the Steering Committee may, by a two-thirds vote, shorten the online discussion and voting period or alternatively put the Proposal to in-person voting alone without absentee voting. If the Steering Committee votes to restrict a given vote to in-person voting only, members present at the in-person vote may, with a two-thirds majority, override the Steering Committee and allow for a three-day absentee voting period following the meeting. In consultation with the Administrative Committee, the Steering Committee may, by a two-thirds majority, postpone absentee voting should a credible security threat be discovered.

## Resolutions

## Definition and function

Resolutions may be adopted by the General Body at any scheduled general body meeting. Resolutions shall require a rationale, a statement of purpose in the form of Whereas clauses, and the action(s) to be taken by the Chapter in the form of Be It Resolved clauses.
## Process

All resolutions considered by the general body shall be put to the following process:

## First Read

A resolution shall be put to a first read at any formally called meeting of the General Body, including General Body Meetings (voting meetings), Informational Meetings (non-voting meetings), Special Meetings, Strategy Forums, and Local Conventions. Any member in good standing may introduce a resolution, so long as they meet the required definitions of a resolution. Members may ask clarifying questions about the introduced resolution, but may not propose amendments, move to a final debate, or vote on the resolution at its first read.

## Second Read

The purpose of the second read is to provide the Steering Committee and interested members an opportunity to make any changes to the resolution before a final vote. At the Second Read, the Steering Committee shall debate the resolution and may propose amendments in an open meeting. Non-steering members present may debate and propose amendments as well. The Steering Committee is not empowered to place a resolution on hold and prevent a resolution from being sent to the Third Read. If a resolution isn’t given a Second Read between GBMs, the resolution is exempt from the Second Read and is sent to the Third Read.

## Third Read

Final Debate, Amendment, and Vote: The purpose of the third read is to take a final vote on any resolution. Resolutions in the third read shall be put to a formal debate and final vote. Rules regarding deliberation shall follow the standard rules of order and any special rules of order adopted by the general body.

## Exceptions to the Three-Reader Process

Any resolution may bypass the first and second reading if it’s considered an Emergency Resolution. To be considered an emergency resolution, the content and purpose of the resolution must be time-sensitive and of crucial importance that warrant the skipping of a one-month consideration period for a resolution. A 2/3rd vote of the Steering Committee or 3/4th vote of a General Body is required to deem a resolution an Emergency Resolution. Emergency Resolutions will follow the regular rules of order required for adoption by the General Body: a majority vote or 2/3rd vote depending on the type of resolution.

## Quorum

A quorum of 5% of the local membership is required for a general body meeting to transact business. If applicable, absentee ballots or votes cast electronically shall count towards attaining quorum of the business to which it pertains to.

## Parliamentary Authority

The rules contained in the current edition of Robert’s Rules of Order Newly Revised shall govern MDCDSA in all cases to which they are applicable and in which they are not inconsistent with these bylaws and any special rules of order that MDCDSA may adopt. The parliamentary authority of MDCDSA shall be adopted by the Steering Committee and the General Body.

## Code of Conduct

MDCDSA members are expected to conduct oneself with civility and respect towards all other members. Unacceptable member behavior includes: creating an intimidating, offensive, and/or abusive environment for other members; engaging in undemocratic or disruptive behavior; engaging in any actions detrimental to the purpose or values of the organization.

## Suspension and Expulsion

If a member’s conduct is found to be in substantial disagreement with the principles or policies of the organization, they will be subject to disciplinary action that may include suspension and/or expulsion from MDC DSA. Members facing suspension or expulsion must receive written notice of charges against them and must be given the opportunity to be heard before the Steering Committee. For a member to be suspended or expelled from MDC DSA, a two-thirds vote of the Steering Committee shall be necessary. Decisions on expulsion by the Steering Committee may be appealed to the National Convention.

During the Audit Period, the Auditors shall be granted full access to all aspects of Metro DC DSA, including the chapter membership list, bank accounts, bookkeeping records, and other sensitive information. Access to this information must be provided under the supervision of each respective responsible party, and must be promptly revoked at the end of each audit period.

## Un-Endorsement

The General Body shall be empowered to rescind the endorsement of an electoral candidate, who has been endorsed locally by MDC DSA, by a two-thirds vote in the affirmative at a general body meeting, with previous notice.

## Censure

The General Body shall be empowered to censure an electoral candidate, who has been endorsed by MDC DSA or DSA National, by a majority vote at a general body meeting, without previous notice.

## Changes to the Bylaws

Members shall have the power to approve changes to the Bylaws. Any proposed changes to the Bylaws shall be announced to the members one meeting in advance of any vote. Changes may be adopted by a vote of two-thirds of the members present.

This includes, but not limited to, being made available on the Chapter’s website and weekly email publication.

Public statements may be submitted by non-sponsors at any time in the consideration process.

Sponsors of a resolution are required to submit a public statement to accompany their proposed resolution.

## Resolutions

Resolutions may be adopted by the the General Body at any scheduled general body meeting. Resolutions shall require a rationale, a statement of purpose in the form of Whereas clauses, and the action(s) to be taken by the Chapter in the form of Be It Resolved clauses.

All resolutions considered by the general body shall be put to the following process:

## First Read

Introduction to General Body & Solicit Feedback: The purpose of the first read is to introduce a resolution concept to the general body and respond to questions.

A resolution shall be put to a first read at a General Body Meeting. Any member in good standing may introduce a resolution.

Members may ask clarifying questions about the introduced resolution, but may not propose amendments, move to a final debate, or vote on the resolution at its first read.

## Second Read

Steering Review & Amendments: The purpose of the second read is to provide the Steering Committee and interested members an opportunity to make any changes to the resolution before a final vote.

At the Second Read, the Steering Committee shall debate the resolution and may propose amendments in an open meeting. Non-steering members present may debate and propose amendments as well.

The Steering Committee is not empowered to place a resolution on hold and prevent a resolution from being sent to the Third Read. If a resolution isn’t given a Second Read between GBMs, the resolution is exempt from the Second Read and is sent to the Third Read.

## Third Read

Final Debate, Amendment, and Vote: The purpose of the third read is to take a final vote on any resolution.

Resolutions in the third read shall be put to a formal debate and final vote. Rules regarding deliberation shall follow the standard rules of order and any special rules of order adopted by the general body.

Any resolution may bypass the first and second reading if it’s considered an Emergency Resolution. To be considered an emergency resolution, the content and purpose of the resolution must be time-sensitive and of crucial importance that warrant the skipping of a one-month consideration period for a resolution. A 2/3rd vote of the Steering Committee or 3/4th vote of a General Body is required to deem a resolution an Emergency Resolution. Emergency Resolutions will follow the regular rules of order required for adoption by the General Body: a majority vote or 2/3rd vote depending on the type of resolution. Any resolution may be rescinded or amended by a majority vote of the general body with previous notice.

## Local Convention

The Metro DC chapter of DSA (“MDCDSA”) shall hold a Local Convention for the purpose of considering amendments to the chapter bylaws and other resolutions every other year, on alternating years from the national convention of the Democratic Socialists of America.

To be eligible to vote as a delegate in the MDCDSA Local Convention, individuals shall be members of MDCDSA in good standing as of 30 days prior to the date on which the convention is to be held, and remain such through the date of the convention. All processes for voting, introducing resolutions, and other administrative affairs pertinent to a Local Convention not specified in these bylaws shall be governed by the Convention Rules approved for that Convention.

All Resolutions and Bylaws Amendments passed at the Local Convention shall become binding requirements on MDCDSA as of 90 days following the date of the Local Convention. This language is not intended to preclude earlier implementation of these Amendments and Resolutions.
